## General

This is a program I plan on using personally. It's more of an ongoing project using whatever framework I'm in the mood for.

## Versions

v1-v-whatever are simply varying things I'm toying with. They aren't incremental. It's just "oh, that sounds neat, I want to check that out".

* v1 : C# /  WinForms
* v2 : C# /  WinForms
* v3 : C# /  WPF
* v4 : C# /  WinUI
* Deleted previous versions because I didn't think I'd care.
* v5 : C# /  Blazor
* v6 : C# /  Blazor
* v7 : C# /  Blazor
* v9 : C# /  WPF
* v10 : C# /  WPF
* v11 : C# /  WPF
* v12 : Swift/SwiftUI/SwiftData
* v13 : Swift/SwiftUI/SwiftData
* v14 : Swift/SwiftUI/SwiftData
* :white_check_mark: v15 : Swift/SwiftUI/SwiftData

Currently on v15 - which is Apple focused. MacOS, first. Followed by iOS (mostly iPhone and then iPad), and then by apple Watch.

Apple focused because I bring my Macbook when I travel instead of a Windows or Linux laptop.

Rough order:

## Various notes / ideas

* Alternate sort methods
* Export/Import: Test: file data, lookups, and link tables
* Unit Testing
* Hard deletes or soft deletes? Currently everything is a hard delete.
* Logging: Should there be a history table which talks about all db changes? This might allow for hard deletes while preserving information
<hr />

* Encrypting important things / encrypting everything / encrypting nothing
* Globalization / Locatlization
* Background service to run bill processing on if something is late?

<hr />
* Do I need to copyright the code? Does it really matter?

## Help Request

* Unit testing. I have no experience here. :(

## General
This is a program I plan on using personally.

## Versions

v1-v-whatever are simply varying things I'm toying with. They aren't incremental. It's just "oh, that sounds neat, I want to check that out".

## TBI

* RecurringTransactionDetails: Handle file data / ability to download
* Files: Consider a lookup for types of files such as bills, contracts, warranties, etc
* Export/Import: Test: file data, lookups, and link tables
* Polish RecurringTransactionDetails. I don't like how it looks.
* Menu adjust so you see where you are / Nav
<hr />

* Encrypting important things. This is a later thing because I'm still manually tweaking things in the database to test and it's simply easier to see mistakes currently.
* Globalization / Locatlization
* Background service to run bill processing on if something is late?

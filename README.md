## General
This is a program I plan on using personally.

## Versions

v1-v-whatever are simply varying things I'm toying with. They aren't incremental. It's just "oh, that sounds neat, I want to check that out".

## TBI

* Encrypting important things. This is a later thing because I'm still manually tweaking things in the database to test and it's simply easier to see mistakes currently.
* Globalization
* Background service to run bill processing on if something is late?
